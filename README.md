# Classification-and-Prediction-of-Phishing-Websites
CLASSIFICATION AND PREDICTION OF PHISHING WEBSITES
This project helps to identify whether a website is phishing website or not using the phishing website dataset.


DATASET DESCRIPTION:

•	Data set consists of 31 columns and 2456 rows of data
•	Each attribute represents how the website can be phished.
•	Of 31 columns, there are 30 feature and 1 class vector.
•	Data Link:

MODELS USED:

To classify and predict the phishing websites , I tried with 2 Models.
•	Support Vector Machine
•	Random Forest

1.	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE:

          I have started with a SVM with an RBF Kernel to predict the parameters of the phishing detection system. SVM model was fitted with the best parameters and the result obtained was really awesome. The prediction accuracy was about 0.9706 which is pretty good for this model. Confusion Matrix is bought after the prediction.
  
        Radial Basis Function Kernel is used to support SVM. RBF Kernel is used to classify the data which is not linearly separable. 

2.	RANDOM FOREST :

      I could not stop by SVM, I wanted to find if there is a way to improve my accuracy and went with the Random Forest Algorithm. Random Forest Algorithm had its own merits. Starting from the identification of best features among all to the most convenient algorithm used, random forest had it all. The prediction accuracy was 0.9739 which is the best prediction result ever. 
 
     It also gives us the best features of all the features.
